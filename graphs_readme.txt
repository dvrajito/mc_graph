220 graphs

Graphs with 50 to 100, 125, 150, 175, and 200 vertices and edges from
2n to n^2/2. Two types of weights: one with little variation (20 to
25, stored in uvar) and one with large variation (1 to 25, stored in
var).

280 graphs

Clustered and spiraled graphs: same numbers of vertices and edges as
before. Can we keep the weights within the same range?

110 clustered graphs

110 spiraled graphs

Spheres and toruses: with and without the diagonal, 1 or 2 diagonals

30 spheres

30 toruses
